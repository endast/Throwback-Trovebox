And after switching to Trovebox i missed the feature that showed you photos from that day, a year, month, week ago etc. So i hacked togheter this simple page to recreate a simple version of that feature. \r\n\r\nIt just loads photos from the specified trovebox account x days ago from today (default a year, a month and a week). Nothing fancy for now :)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n* Add ability to look for photos if none are found, for example if no photos is found 1 year ago we could search 1year ago +-1 one day etc\r\n* Add gui to discover photos (so you could show photos from x weeks/years/days ago without editing the source)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nEdit the openphoto.js line\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"js/OpenPhoto.js\" data-site=\"http://photo.example.com\"></script>\r\n\r\nand change data-site to your trovebox installation.\r\n\r\nIf you want to edit the template you have to compile it using hulk (hogan.js)\r\n    \r\n    npm install hogan.js -g\r\n\r\n    cd /path/to/download/Throwback_Trovebox/templates\r\n\r\n    hulk photos.mustache > ../js/templates.js (Or run the bash script from this dir)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endast/Throwback-Trovebox/master/example-images/1.png\" style=\"width:400px; margin:auto;\">\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endast/Throwback-Trovebox/master/example-images/2.png\" style=\"width:400px; margin:auto;\">\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
